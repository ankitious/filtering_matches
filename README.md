Packages used to build this project.

- ReactJS

- ExpressJS 

- Chai + Mocha + Istambul

Due to time constraint couldn't complete : 
   
   - Some parts in server side can be updated with functional programming (RamdaJS).
   - Use redux for state management and redux-saga to handle asynchronicity.
   - client code can be divided into more smaller components.
   - some variable names might not be exact as it should be.
